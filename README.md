This is a private server clone of the same frontend application I wrote for Stephen Gould Indianapolis as part of a de facto Software Engineering internship in summer 2020. It aims to simplify and streamline the shipping and receiving process within their warehouse through the use of the FullCalendar js library and a Firebase backend to allow relevant personel to manage their receiving schedule and maintain necessary paperwork.
